# Leetflix CLI 

Leetflix is a simple software, mostly made for having fun in some hot summer days, which helps you watch your favorite movies from the command line! But you know what makes it cooler? Of course you do. You won't pay a single penny to Netflix, HBO or Disney+ and you have tons of movies in your hand with a simple python script. 

So, you want to run it? let's do the shit together. 

## Prerequisites

* A computer with _macOS_, _Linux_ or _Windows_ operating systems (The code has been tested on _macOS_ and worked fine.)
* `nodejs` and `npm` installed. 
* `webtorrent-cli` installed (to install it, you just run `npm i webtorrent-cli -g` in the command line.)
* VLC media player 
* Python installed on your computer (version 3.8 is preferred, as I developed the software in Python 3.8)

## How to use 

It's really simple. First, open up a command line window and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

Then just run the code : 

```
python3 ./leetflix.py
``` 

The rest of the work is completely easy :)
